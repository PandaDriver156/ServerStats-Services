<img src="https://github.com/TheChickenNagget/assets/blob/master/images/Capture.PNG"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />
     
        "elements": [
            "Cloudflare Sites and Services",
            "Africa",
            "Asia",

            "Middle East",
            "North America",
            "Oceania"
        ] 
        
> - We have to select all elements to exclude other elements like "past incidents" and more, example above.
> - The ```elements``` are **Optional**
------
> 4rd line
> - Thumbnail, you need to select the service's icon/thumbnail, in this example we used cloudflare's icon url 
> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699617640099872848/699984616408350821/CloudflareLogo.png
> - You can select any image URL, but it has to be readable. We recommend images with the following extension: ```.png .webp .jpeg```
> - The Thumbnail Is **Optional**, But is Highly Recommended.
------
> 5th line
> - Replace, determines whether the service name should be replaced (with an empty string) in the component name. For example, Cloudflare has a property called "Cloudflare Sites and Services", but since replace is true, ServerStats only writes "Sites and Services", without Cloudflare
> - Replace is Optional, Replace does return ```false``` by default
------
> 6th Line
> - Capitalization, capitalization is optional (by default, only the first letter will be written with big letter)
------
> 7th Line
> - Aliases, example: We have service called ```epic games```, you can add alias ```epic``` to make it more easier for the users to find the service, Aliases Should Be **LowerCase** !!
> - Aliases are **optional**
